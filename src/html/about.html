          <h2>About the company</h2>
          <p>
            The plant is notorious for being poorly maintained, largely due to
            owner Charles Montgomery Burns' miserliness and safety inspector
            Homer Simpson's incompetence. A surprise inspection found over 342
            violations with an estimated $56 million required to bring the plant
            up to code, money which Burns refused to spend. Notable safety
            violations that have been seen include luminous rats in the bowels
            of the building, pipes and drums leaking radioactive waste, the
            disposal of waste in a children's playground, plutonium used as a
            paperweight, cracked cooling towers (fixed in one episode using a
            piece of chewing gum), skeletons in the basement, dangerously high
            Geiger counter readings around the perimeter of the plant, flashing
            red alert signs being ignored by employees, the creation of a mutant
            subspecies of three-eyed fish and a horrific giant spider. The
            Emergency Exits are simply painted on.

          <h2>About the teamet</h2>
          <p>
            A break room is where most staff spend their coffee breaks. The room
            is usually stocked with coffee and donuts. There is a bulletin board
            on the wall that has a poster showing how to perform the Heimlich
            Maneuver.
          </p>
          <h2>Head of operation</h2>
          <p>
            Charles Montgomery Plantagenet Schicklgruber Burns, also known as
            Monty Burns, Montgomery Burns, C.M. Burns, and Mr. Burns, is the
            owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and the main antagonist
            of The Simpsons franchise. He is Springfield's richest, oldest, and
            most powerful citizen. His net worth has been stated to be in the
            billions and in one instance was pegged at exactly $1,800,037,022.
